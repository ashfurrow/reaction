the post-war period, is perhaps best-known for the large-scale outdoor
installations and long, spacious interiors he designed in Marfa, Texas. His
oeuvre has come to define what has been referred to as Minimalist art—a label
the artist strongly objected to. His sculptures and installations, constructed
out of industrial materials such as Plexiglas, concrete, and steel and arranged
in precise geometric shapes, were intended to emphasize the purity of the
objects themselves rather than any symbolic meaning they might have—“the simple
expression of complex thought,” said Judd. His particular interest in
architecture led him to design both the sculptures and the spaces in which they
would be contained. Donald Judd, widely regarded as one of the most significant
